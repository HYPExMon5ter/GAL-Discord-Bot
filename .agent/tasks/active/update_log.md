- [ ] Archive outdated snapshot files
- [ ] Reconcile canvas editor status documentation

### Follow-up Items
- [ ] Train team on new SOPs
- [ ] Update development workflows

## Issues Requiring Attention

### High Priority
1. **Canvas Editor Status Mismatch**: Task shows completed but snapshot shows partially recovered
2. **Frontend Documentation**: `frontend-components.md` needs update for vibrant UI
3. **Architecture Overview**: `architecture.md` last updated 2025-10-11, needs refresh

### Medium Priority
1. **Cross-Reference Audit**: Check `system-cross-references.md` for broken links
2. **Snapshot Cleanup**: Archive outdated snapshot files
3. **Task Indexing**: Create task completion index
